<h2>Heuristic Analysis:</h2>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">As a teacher, I wanted students to look up views and articles about Marijuana in the Tower Archives. I started off by searching for “weed”, and then searching for similar terms such as “marijuana.” There are not too many results in the archive for these search terms. However, under semantic search the student can get around 18 results. The results would be enough for a decent amount of research for the students to see what what were the priorities of the time. 
</p>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>The site design is relatively easy to use, with a student being able to search directly from the link that would be sent to them by an instructor. Key terms are able to be found in the document easily with the search bar at the top of the document itself and the “search matches” drop down menu on the side. In addition, there is also the collection by date, which would be good for students looking for specific time periods of information.</li>
<li>In Heuritic terms, the system is using recognition rather than recall and is also using the users language. In addition, the system itself has a minimalistic and easily useable design making all available information clear and easy to use for student use and cognition.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>However, there are many parts where a user can go astray. If a user wanted to use the advanced search function that JSTOR provides, the advanced search function would not be able to work under the Tower Archives. So a student could click “Advanced Search” at the top of the page and make it seem like they can get more information that way. However, it would take the user to the whole JSTOR archive instead.In Heuristic terms there is no error prevention to let the user know they are leaving the tower archives. There is also no way to tell users to go back to the archives except to go back to the original search page. A user can press the back arrow as well, but it could leave a lot of confusion in its wake.</li>
<li>Another part of the system that is not necessarily the archives fault, but a fault of the system is the new AI tool of “Semantic Search.” It is overall confusing and would not be helpful for the assigned project if a student needed to stay within the archives themselves. It does not allow for flexibility of use, and instead can hinder research if the AI technology is not matching to the article properly like it is meant to.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 2: Mini-Usibilty Test<h2>

<h3>Task 1:</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The user was given the task of exploring how the CUA student newspaper has changed over the years. They began by looking at random news articles and briefly reading through each one. They were also reading through the citation information as well. They then go to the search bar to use more detailed filtering to find what they are looking for. Still, they are not getting any results for the search terms they are looking for. They try to use the year format of searching and nothing comes up. Doing it by date has to be very specific they find out. Some common phrases used are, “This thing hates me,” and, “Guess I have to search by term.” The user also got very off task exploring the JSTOR platform and accidentally searched out of the archive.
</p>

<h3>Task 2:</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">For the second task, they imagined that they were a teacher looking for material about campus perspectives on World War II and the Vietnam War. They tried to find two articles about each conflict that effectively illustrate some aspect about campus attitudes and activities. When they began searching up “World War 2 and Vietnam War,” they were getting articles about casino night which confused them. They found that the search function was getting more results about the paper adds rather than the content. They also tried using advanced search to use keywords. However, found out that advanced search is not available in the tower archive. They thought it was very strange that they could do the advances search on the main cover but could not do advanced search for The Tower Archive. Nothing was still coming up for World War 2 or the Vietnam War. Found out they can narrow their search for 1975 to 1980. They were able to successfully get results this way. Appreciated that they could command+F in the Pdf to find terms. Hard to find anything about Vietnam and said aloud, “Would not think war is imminent.” They had to look for the week after the war began, and the earliest article being November 14th, 1955. They then try reading through the article and finds nothing actually related even when it was brought up in the search. The following December mentions documentary about the war, but not student sentiment. They were annoyed that there are no drill down for key words on the side, and found the keyword function did not work. By the end, they were fascinated that the school did not talk about these two major wars very much.
</p>

<h2>Final Analysis</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I will say that there were a lot of similarities between my heuristic analysis and the mini-usability test. In both instances, there was a need to narrow down the search and use the functions that come allong with the advanced search. However, they were not available to users in The Tower Archive and the only way to narrow down the search was by key terms and date. It was also found that in the older editorials of The Tower, the search function does not work as well as the newer editions. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">Suggestions for improvement would have to be to allow for more of an advanced search within the archives itself. While the archive itself is not as large of the whole of JSTOR, it would still benefit of having this function so users do not get confused. Or, the site can have clear messaging when their users are leaving The Tower archives.
